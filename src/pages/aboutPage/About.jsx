              I'm a 21-year-old web developer. I discovered my passion for
              programming few years ago. I am a software programming technician
              and, for 4 years, I have dedicated myself to learning different
              technologies, being everything that has to do with web development
              my favorite. Now I seek to develop my skills in a work environment
              that allows me to continue doing what I like.Â

              Talking a little more about myself, I like origami, string
              instruments and reading philosophy especially when I don't
              understand it. I love challenges and I am too competitive. Finally
              I would like to add that I studied psychology for 4 years... long
              story.
